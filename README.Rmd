The goal of the `sfcr` package is to provide an intuitive and `tidy` way to estimate stock-flow consistent (SFC) models with R. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joaomacalos/sfcr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to simulate the "SIM" model from @godley2007monetary [ch. 3], as well as how to add scenarios to this baseline model.

The `sfcr_set()` function is used to create define the equations and external variables of the model.

These sets are used to simulate the baseline scenario of the model with the `sfcr_baseline()` function:

```{r example}
library(sfcr)

eqs <- sfcr_set(
  TXs ~ TXd,
  YD ~ W * Ns - TXs,
  Cd ~ alpha1 * YD + alpha2 * Hh[-1],
  Hh ~ YD - Cd + Hh[-1],
  Ns ~ Nd,
  Nd ~ Y / W,
  Cs ~ Cd,
  Gs ~ Gd,
  Y ~ Cs + Gs,
  TXd ~ theta * W * Ns,
  Hs ~ Gd - TXd + Hs[-1]
)

external <- sfcr_set(
  Gd ~ 20, 
  W ~ 1,
  alpha1 ~ 0.6,
  alpha2 ~ 0.4,
  theta ~ 0.2
  )

sim <- sfcr_baseline(
  equations = eqs, 
  external = external,
  periods = 60, 
  
  )

sim
```

With the steady state values at hand, we can use the `sfcr_scenario()` function to see what happens if we increase government expenditures `Gd` from 20 to 30:

```{r}
shock <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    Gd ~ 30
  ),
  start = 5,
  end = 60
)

sim2 <- sfcr_scenario(
  baseline = sim,
  scenario = shock,
  periods = 60
  )

sim2
```

With `sfcr`, the models are written entirely within R and use the standard R syntax. Furthermore, their output is a `tibble`, meaning that it can be easily manipulated with `dplyr` and other `tidyverse` tools and plotted with `ggplot2`.

### Acknowledgments

I'm grateful to Severin Reissl for his very useful comments and for always pointing me in the right direction, to Marc Lavoie for answering all my questions about SFC modeling, and to Italo Pedrosa for our discussions about the state of the SFC field. 

I'd also like to acknowledge all the developers and academics that share their code and make the SFC field alive. In particular, many thanks to Antoine Godin for answering all my queries about the `PKSFC` [package](https://github.com/S120/PKSFC), from which I draw much inspiration, specially in the DAGs section of the package, to Gabriel Petrini da Silveira and Kenn Takara for their `pysolve3` [package](https://github.com/gpetrini/pysolve3), from which I found the references to implement the Broyden solver in R, and to Gennaro Zezza for his invaluable [macros](http://gennaro.zezza.it/software/eviews/gl2006.php) to simulate the models in @godley2007monetary.
