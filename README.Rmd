The goal of the `sfcr` package is to provide an intuitive and `tidy` way to estimate stock-flow consistent (SFC) models with R. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joaomacalos/sfcr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to simulate the "SIM" model from @godley2007monetary [ch. 3], as well as how to add scenarios to this baseline model.

The `sfcr_set()` function is used to create define the equations and external variables of the model.

These sets are used to simulate the baseline scenario of the model with the `sfcr_baseline()` function:

```{r example}
library(sfcr)

eqs <- sfcr_set(
  TXs ~ TXd,
  YD ~ W * Ns - TXs,
  Cd ~ alpha1 * YD + alpha2 * Hh[-1],
  Hh ~ YD - Cd + Hh[-1],
  Ns ~ Nd,
  Nd ~ Y / W,
  Cs ~ Cd,
  Gs ~ Gd,
  Y ~ Cs + Gs,
  TXd ~ theta * W * Ns,
  Hs ~ Gd - TXd + Hs[-1]
)

external <- sfcr_set(
  Gd ~ 20, 
  W ~ 1,
  alpha1 ~ 0.6,
  alpha2 ~ 0.4,
  theta ~ 0.2
  )

sim <- sfcr_baseline(
  equations = eqs, 
  external = external,
  periods = 60, 
  
  )

sim
```

With the steady state values at hand, we can use the `sfcr_scenario()` function to see what happens if we increase government expenditures `Gd` from 20 to 30:

```{r}
shock <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    Gd ~ 30
  ),
  start = 5,
  end = 60
)

sim2 <- sfcr_scenario(
  baseline = sim,
  scenario = shock,
  periods = 60
  )

sim2
```

With `sfcr`, the models are written entirely within R and use the standard R syntax. Furthermore, their output is a `tibble`, meaning that it can be easily manipulated with `dplyr` and other `tidyverse` tools and plotted with `ggplot2`.
